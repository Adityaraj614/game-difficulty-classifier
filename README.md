# Game Difficulty Classifier 🎮🤖

This project builds a multiclass machine learning system to classify
game difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) using synthesized gameplay data.

## Project Motivation
Balancing game difficulty manually is time-consuming and subjective.
This project explores how machine learning can automate difficulty
classification based on measurable gameplay parameters.

## Difficulty Classes
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

## Key Features (Planned)
- Enemy density
- Health pickups availability
- Player accuracy required
- Time limits
- Map complexity

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Roadmap
- Phase 0: Repository setup
- Phase 1: Data synthesis & label engineering
- Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Phase 3: Model training (Random Forest)
- Phase 4: Evaluation & error analysis
- Phase 5: Documentation & insights
